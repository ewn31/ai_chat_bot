Comprehensive Guide for Inclusive Menstrual Health Support
Understanding Menstrual Dignity
Q: What is menstrual dignity?
Menstrual dignity is a human rights-based approach ensuring that everyone who menstruates can manage their period safely, confidently, and without shame, stigma, or discrimination—regardless of their gender, age, location, or economic status. It goes beyond access to products and encompasses comprehensive support including education, facilities, freedom from stigma, inclusion, and policy support.
Q: Who menstruates?
Menstruation is not limited to cisgender women. Trans men, non-binary individuals, intersex people, and others may also menstruate. It's important to use inclusive language like 'people who menstruate' or 'menstruators' alongside references to women and girls to ensure everyone feels recognized and supported.
Q: What are the key elements of menstrual dignity?
The six key elements are:
Access to safe, affordable, and appropriate menstrual products
Access to safe, private, and hygienic facilities with clean water and proper disposal options
Accurate, age-appropriate, and inclusive education about menstruation
Freedom from stigma, shame, and taboos
Inclusion and equity for all menstruators regardless of gender identity
Policy and legal support including removal of tampon taxes and free access where needed
General Menstrual Information
Q: What is menstruation?
Menstruation is the monthly shedding of the uterine lining when pregnancy has not occurred. It typically lasts 3-7 days and occurs approximately every 21-35 days, though cycles vary from person to person. The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormones including estrogen and progesterone.
Q: How do I calculate my menstrual cycle?
Your menstrual cycle is counted from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period. Track the start date of your period each month. After a few months, you can identify patterns. The average cycle is 28 days, but anywhere from 21-35 days is normal. Many apps and calendars can help with tracking.
Q: Why do menstrual cramps occur?
Menstrual cramps (dysmenorrhea) occur when the uterus contracts to shed its lining. The uterus produces hormone-like substances called prostaglandins that trigger these contractions. Higher levels of prostaglandins can cause more severe cramping. Pain may also be caused by conditions like endometriosis or fibroids.
Q: Why is menstrual blood sometimes black or dark brown?
Dark brown or black menstrual blood is usually old blood that has taken longer to exit the uterus and has oxidized. This is most common at the beginning or end of a period and is generally normal. However, if accompanied by unusual symptoms like severe pain, foul odor, or irregular cycles, consult a healthcare provider.
Q: Can I use ibuprofen for menstrual cramps?
Yes, ibuprofen is highly effective for menstrual cramps. It works by reducing the production of prostaglandins, the hormone-like substances that cause uterine contractions and pain. Studies show ibuprofen is significantly more effective than aspirin or placebo for menstrual pain relief.
Q: What is the proper dosage of ibuprofen for menstrual cramps?
For menstrual cramps, adults can typically take 200-400mg every 4-6 hours as needed. For more severe pain, doctors may recommend 600-800mg every 6 hours, but this higher dose should be discussed with a healthcare provider first. The maximum safe daily dose is 2,400mg (twelve 200mg pills). Always take the minimum effective dose. Important tips: (1) Take ibuprofen with food or milk to reduce stomach upset, (2) Start taking it at the first sign of cramps or even before they begin for best results, (3) Do not exceed recommended dosages without medical supervision.
Q: Can ibuprofen reduce menstrual flow?
Yes, ibuprofen can reduce menstrual bleeding by up to 50% in some people. By reducing prostaglandin production, it decreases uterine shedding, leading to less bleeding and fewer cramps. This effect is most noticeable when taking 800mg three times daily, ideally starting right before or when your period begins. However, this is a short-term solution and not recommended for long-term management of heavy bleeding.
Q: Are there any risks or side effects of using ibuprofen for periods?
While generally safe when used as directed, ibuprofen can have side effects. Short-term effects may include nausea, stomach upset, heartburn, and dizziness. Long-term or high-dose use may increase risk of stomach bleeding, ulcers, kidney problems, and cardiovascular issues. People with heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, bleeding disorders, or a history of stomach ulcers should consult a doctor before using ibuprofen. Avoid alcohol when taking ibuprofen and stay hydrated. If regular pain medication doesn't help after three months, consult a healthcare provider as this may indicate underlying conditions like endometriosis.
Q: What are alternatives to ibuprofen for menstrual pain relief?
Other pain management options include: (1) Other NSAIDs like naproxen, (2) Heat therapy using heating pads or warm baths, (3) TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) devices, (4) Exercise and physical activity, (5) Hormonal birth control to regulate cycles, (6) Traditional Chinese Medicine herbs and acupuncture, (7) Omega-3 supplements which may reduce prostaglandin production. A combination of methods often works best.
Menstrual Products
Q: What types of menstrual products are available?
Available menstrual products include:
Disposable pads (sanitary pads/napkins)
Tampons (internal absorbent products)
Menstrual cups (reusable silicone cups)
Period underwear (absorbent, washable underwear)
Reusable cloth pads
Menstrual discs
Q: How do I properly dispose of used menstrual products?
For disposable products (pads and tampons): Wrap them in toilet paper or the wrapper from a fresh product, then dispose of them in a waste bin—never flush them down the toilet as they can cause plumbing blockages. For reusable products (cups, cloth pads, period underwear): Rinse with cold water, then wash according to product instructions, typically with soap and water or in a washing machine.
Q: What menstrual products are more comfortable for masculine-presenting menstruators?
Many masculine-presenting menstruators prefer products that are discreet and align with their gender presentation. Options include:
Period underwear designed with boxer brief styles (brands like TomboyX, Thinx Boyshorts, Period Aisle)
Menstrual cups or discs (longer wear time, less frequent changing)
Gender-neutral packaged products (brands like Aunt Flow, Einhorn, Vuokkoset)
Dark-colored or cargo pants with pockets for discreet carrying
Q: Are menstrual pain reliever machines effective?
Menstrual pain reliever machines, often using TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) technology, can be effective for some people. They work by sending electrical pulses through the skin to block pain signals. Studies show mixed results, but many users report relief from cramps. They are drug-free alternatives that can be used alongside other pain management methods. Effectiveness varies by individual.
Sex and Menstruation
Q: Is it safe to have sex during menstruation?
Yes, sex during menstruation is generally safe for most people. There is no medical reason to avoid sexual activity during your period. However, it's important to note that the risk of transmitting or contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may be slightly higher during menstruation because blood can serve as a medium for pathogens. Always use barrier protection like condoms or dental dams.
Q: Can you get pregnant during your period?
While less likely, pregnancy is still possible during menstruation. Sperm can survive in the body for up to 5 days. If you have a shorter menstrual cycle (21-24 days) or longer periods, ovulation may occur soon after your period ends, and the surviving sperm could fertilize an egg. Always use contraception if you don't want to become pregnant, regardless of where you are in your cycle.
Q: Does sex during menstruation help with cramps?
Yes, sexual activity during menstruation can help alleviate cramps for some people. Orgasm causes the uterus to contract, which can help expel menstrual blood more quickly and release endorphins—natural pain-relieving hormones. These endorphins, along with other feel-good hormones like dopamine and oxytocin released during sex, can reduce pain and improve mood.
Q: Are there increased chances of getting an infection during sex while menstruating?
There is a slightly increased risk of infection during period sex for several reasons: (1) The vaginal pH becomes more alkaline during menstruation (typically 3.8-5.0, but higher during periods), allowing microbes to survive and multiply more easily; (2) Blood can serve as a medium for pathogens, increasing STI transmission risk, particularly for blood-borne infections like hepatitis and HIV; (3) Hormonal changes can make you more susceptible to yeast infections. Using condoms or dental dams significantly reduces these risks.
Q: Can the potency of condoms and lubricants be affected by menstrual blood?
No, menstrual blood does not affect the effectiveness of condoms or lubricants. Condoms remain effective barriers against pregnancy and STIs during menstruation. Menstrual blood can actually provide natural lubrication, though you may still choose to use additional water-based lubricant if desired. Always ensure tampons or menstrual cups are removed before penetrative sex.
Q: How does menstruation affect sex or intimacy?
Menstruation affects intimacy differently for everyone. Some experience increased libido and heightened sensitivity due to increased blood flow to the pelvic area, making sex more pleasurable. Others may experience discomfort or reduced desire. Emotionally, some feel more connected to partners due to increased oxytocin levels during menstruation. Open communication with partners about comfort levels and preferences is key to positive experiences.
LGBTQ+ and Trans-Specific Information
Q: How do trans men and non-binary people experience menstruation?
Trans men and non-binary individuals who were assigned female at birth may continue to menstruate, especially if they are not on hormone therapy or if their hormone levels don't stop menstruation completely. Studies show that 93% of trans men experience menstrual-related gender dysphoria, which can cause significant mental distress. Menstruation may feel wrong, uncomfortable, or dysphoric as it conflicts with their gender identity.
Q: Does testosterone stop menstruation?
Testosterone typically stops menstruation within a few months of starting hormone replacement therapy. However, this varies by individual, and some trans men may continue to experience menstruation even while on testosterone. Additionally, some trans men choose not to undergo hormone therapy, so menstruation continues as normal. Not all trans or non-binary people want or have access to hormone therapy.
Q: What challenges do trans and non-binary menstruators face in public spaces?
Trans and non-binary menstruators face several challenges:
Men's bathrooms often lack disposal bins in stalls, making it difficult to discard menstrual products
Fear of violence or harassment when using public restrooms while menstruating
Risk of being 'outed' by carrying visibly feminine menstrual products
Gendered marketing and pink/purple packaging that emphasizes femininity
Products labeled as 'feminine hygiene' or placed in 'women's' sections
Healthcare providers who misgender or lack training in gender-affirming care
Q: What are some gender-affirming strategies for managing menstruation?
Gender-affirming menstrual management strategies include:
Using extended-wear products like menstrual cups, period underwear, or adult diapers to reduce bathroom trips
Choosing products with neutral or masculine packaging
Wearing dark-colored or cargo pants with pockets for discreet carrying
Using boxer brief-style period underwear
Seeking gender-neutral or all-gender restrooms when available
Discussing menstrual suppression options with gender-affirming healthcare providers
Health and Safety
Q: What is the risk of infection during menstruation?
During menstruation, there is a slightly elevated risk of certain infections due to hormonal changes that can affect vaginal pH and immune response. The risk of yeast infections may increase, and if engaging in sexual activity, there's a higher risk of STI transmission. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can also be more common during or after menstruation. Proper hygiene, regular changing of menstrual products, and barrier protection during sex can minimize these risks.
Q: How can I maintain good menstrual hygiene?
Good menstrual hygiene practices include:
Change pads every 4-6 hours and tampons every 4-8 hours
Wash hands before and after changing menstrual products
Bathe or shower regularly, washing the external genital area with mild soap and water
Empty menstrual cups every 8-12 hours and clean according to instructions
Dispose of products properly in waste bins, never in toilets
Wash reusable products thoroughly with soap and water
Q: When should I seek medical attention for menstrual issues?
Seek medical attention if you experience:
Periods lasting longer than 7 days
Extremely heavy bleeding (soaking through a pad/tampon every hour)
Severe pain that interferes with daily activities
Irregular periods (missing periods or very frequent periods)
Foul-smelling discharge
Fever or signs of infection
Bleeding between periods
Stigma and Education
Q: Why is there stigma around menstruation?
Menstrual stigma exists due to cultural taboos, religious beliefs, lack of education, and historical views of menstruation as dirty or shameful. In many cultures, menstruation is seen as a private matter not to be discussed openly, particularly with men or boys. This silence perpetuates myths and misunderstandings. Challenging these taboos through education and open conversation helps normalize periods and reduce shame.
Q: How can we reduce menstrual stigma?
Reducing menstrual stigma requires:
Open conversations about menstruation in schools, homes, and communities
Including boys, men, and people of all genders in menstrual education
Using inclusive language that recognizes not only women menstruate
Providing accurate, age-appropriate information in educational settings
Challenging myths and cultural taboos through evidence-based information
Normalizing periods in media and public discourse
Q: What should menstrual education include?
Comprehensive menstrual education should cover:
Biological processes of the menstrual cycle
Different menstrual products and how to use them
Hygiene practices and health considerations
Emotional and physical changes during the cycle
Gender inclusivity—recognizing that people of all genders may menstruate
Cultural sensitivity and challenging stigma
When to seek medical help
Common Myths About Menstrual Cramps
Q: Myth - Severe menstrual cramps are normal and you just have to deal with them. True or false?
FALSE. While mild to moderate cramps are common, severe pain that interferes with daily activities is NOT normal and should not be dismissed. Debilitating cramps may be a sign of underlying conditions like endometriosis, adenomyosis, fibroids, or other medical issues. Approximately 20% of menstruators experience severe pain that disrupts their routines. If your cramps are extremely painful or don't respond to treatment after three months, seek medical attention.
Q: Myth - You can't exercise during your period. True or false?
FALSE. Not only is it safe to exercise during menstruation, but physical activity can actually help reduce cramps and improve mood. Exercise increases blood circulation, releases endorphins (natural pain relievers), and boosts serotonin levels. You may need to adjust intensity based on how you feel, but there's no medical reason to avoid working out during your period. Many people find that exercise helps alleviate menstrual symptoms.
Q: Myth - You can't swim during your period. True or false?
FALSE. Swimming during menstruation is completely safe. Water does not stop your period, and menstrual blood will not contaminate a pool. Use a tampon or menstrual cup (not a pad) while swimming. Many people find that swimming helps relieve cramps. The myth that water stops cramps or periods is unfounded—uterine contractions continue regardless of water temperature or activity.
Q: Myth - You can't take baths or wash your hair during your period. True or false?
FALSE. There is absolutely no reason to change your hygiene habits during menstruation. In fact, maintaining good hygiene is especially important during your period. Warm baths can actually help relieve cramps. The myth about not washing hair or bathing during periods has no scientific basis and likely stems from outdated cultural taboos.
Q: Myth - Menstrual blood is dirty or toxic. True or false?
FALSE. Menstrual blood is not dirty, toxic, or contaminated. It consists of blood, endometrial tissue, and vaginal secretions—all natural bodily fluids. There is nothing uniquely dangerous about menstrual blood compared to other bodily fluids. This harmful myth has led to practices like isolating menstruating people in 'period huts' and perpetuates shame. Menstrual blood is a natural and healthy part of the reproductive cycle.
Q: Myth - Using painkillers for cramps causes infertility. True or false?
FALSE. Pain relievers like ibuprofen, when used as directed, have no connection to infertility. This is a dangerous myth that may prevent people from managing their pain effectively. Over-the-counter pain medications are safe for treating menstrual cramps when used according to medical guidance and not exceeding recommended dosages. However, always consult a doctor about proper usage.
Q: Myth - Using a menstrual cup reduces cramping. True or false?
FALSE. While menstrual cups are a great product option, they do not reduce cramps. Cramps are caused by prostaglandins triggering uterine contractions to shed the endometrial lining. The type of menstrual product you use doesn't affect prostaglandin production or uterine contractions. Pain relief comes from methods that address the underlying cause, such as NSAIDs, heat therapy, or exercise.
Q: Myth - Periods sync up when people spend time together. True or false?
FALSE. Despite being a popular belief, scientific research does not support the idea of menstrual synchrony. Each person's menstrual cycle is governed by their unique hormonal balance and can differ in duration and timing. When periods seem to sync, it's coincidence rather than an actual physiological process. Humans do not have pheromones that cause cycle synchronization.
Q: Myth - All menstrual cycles are 28 days long. True or false?
FALSE. While 28 days is often cited as the 'average' cycle length, normal menstrual cycles can range from 21 to 35 days. Cycle length varies between individuals and can even vary from month to month for the same person. There is no single 'correct' cycle length, and variation is completely normal.
Q: Myth - PMS is not real, it's just an excuse. True or false?
FALSE. Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a real medical condition experienced by many menstruators. It involves physical and emotional symptoms like bloating, breast tenderness, mood swings, headaches, food cravings, and fatigue that occur in the luteal phase (after ovulation). The severity varies widely between individuals. Some people experience Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), a more severe form recognized in medical classifications that requires professional treatment. Dismissing PMS invalidates real experiences and prevents people from seeking help.
Q: Myth - You can't get pregnant during your period. True or false?
FALSE. While pregnancy during menstruation is less likely, it is still possible. Sperm can survive in the body for up to 5 days. If you have a shorter cycle (21-24 days) or longer periods, ovulation may occur soon after your period ends, potentially leading to pregnancy. Always use contraception if you don't want to become pregnant, regardless of where you are in your cycle.
Q: Myth - Drinking cold water or bathing in cold water makes cramps worse. True or false?
FALSE. Cold water consumption or cold baths do not increase uterine contractions or worsen cramps. This myth lacks scientific basis. While some people may find warm baths more soothing for cramps, cold water does not harm you or intensify menstrual pain. However, in Traditional Chinese Medicine, avoiding cold exposure is recommended for those with certain body constitutions.
